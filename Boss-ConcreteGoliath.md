## Colossus
Your body is treated as having 3 main sections: Lower, Upper, Weakpoint. Each section has separate Health/Armor and gets its own Card (except weakpoint) gets its own Initiative Card.    
**Lower** : Responsible for movement, trampling. Stunned on Injury, causing the creature to be Knocked Down.  
**Upper**: Responsible for arms, grappling.  
**Heart**: Responsible for Search, Influence, Magic, etc. A critical weakpoint (whether it be eyes, head, heart, etc). The Heart is considered to be Medium(3) and In Cover. It has no Armor and does not benefit from Damage Resistance. It can only be reached with Melee Attacks by Climbing the colossus, unless it has been Knocked Down.  
 
 - Can't be Flanked by smaller creatures
 - Can't make Free Attacks against creatures 2+ sizes smaller, unless they are climbing the Colossus' body
